## This is a minimal three-server layout:

Server1 = HAProxy (LB); Server2 = Nginx web server; Server3 = App server which also hosts MySQL Primary.

The Nginx server serves static assets, does caching, and reverse-proxies to the app server. HAProxy routes traffic to the Nginx server(s).

Application files (codebase) live on the application server (or in a shared repo/artifact deployed to the web/app servers).

HAProxy (Load Balancer) — in front, accepts client requests and distributes them to web servers.

Why: hides backend servers, provides health checks, enables scaling and zero-downtime deploys.

Nginx (Web server / reverse proxy) — serves static files quickly, TLS offloading (if present), and forwards dynamic requests to the application.

Why: static files and caching are faster at the web tier; offloads work from app server.

Application Server (app runtime) — runs business logic, runs the codebase, connects to the DB.

Why: executes dynamic logic, processes requests that need database access, business rules.

MySQL (Database) — persistent storage for users, sessions, data.

Why: durable, ACID storage for application data.

Application files (code base) — deployed to the app server (and potentially to web servers for SSR/static assets).

Why: the code the app runs — must be deployed and versioned.
